        <p>One truck 6x12" truck. Eleven Months. Four motors, five pneumatic cylinders, three springs, a giant
            pile
            of bricks. One complete creation of awesome.</p>

        <p>Started May 2006, this was a project to cram as much finely tuned fully accurate functionality as
            possible in to as small a space as possible, my favorite style. Inspired by many model builders
            before
            me, I decided to make my own path in the world of Lego truck making, with a smaller, cheaper, more
            highly functional, more carefully designed model than most ever seen before. It was built only one
            step
            at a time, with only a few pictures of the actual truck to work from. The end result, however, was
            beautiful and very <em>very</em> red.</p>

        <p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>

        <p><em>This is how I am:</em>
            <br/>I grew up on a farm in upstate New York, son of two dairy cow veterinarians. I am in-between a brother
            and
            sister, yes
            I had a lot of free time for thinking, and yes it gets pretty cold up there. I've was homeschooled all the
            way
            until college,
            just because my parents didn't have a lot of respect for our American school system. What I learned and who
            I am
            because
            of this has lead me to a great deal of interesting places and wonderful people. And for some reason, totally
            beyond me,
            this causes me to leave a good impression on most that I meet.</p>

        <p>When I was 16, I applied to a university and got in to it, doing Mechanical Engineering. It turns out that
            this
            was a good idea,
            because it brought
            me in to the more of the world. It was also a bad idea, because it was still very cold up there and we
            didn't get a lot of attention from the anywhere important to me.</p>

        <p>By Summer 2010, I had been teaching myself web development for a while and had heard that if I went to
            Silicon
            Valley,
            I could get a job pretty quickly. So with a fallback plan of freelancing in Argentina (why not?), I went
            forward
            with
            booking a room on Airbnb.com the night before I left. This certainly had a powerful impact on things, as
            they
            were hiring,
            Over three interviews in one weekend I passed various tests, and was hired in to the most powerful and
            vibrant
            community I have ever even witnessed.</p>


        <p>After four months of living and breathing pure Airbnb I went back to school, and required all the persuasion
            from teachers,
            family, relatives and best friends not to drop out and go help found a Chicago-based school of Lego&mdash; I
            would
            have gone
            but that all the people
            <a class="domain_change" data-name='Outbound Links'
               href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/peter-thiel-drop-out-of-school/">
                telling me to leave</a>, I didn't know myself. I kept busy with entrepreneurial
            machinations, but
            eventually had had too much. Half way through the Vietnam episode of top gear, I texted a friend and bought
            tickets to China
            for the day after christmas, stopping out six art credits short of my engineering degree.</p>

        <p>I've been traveling since. I've written some interesting things on my blog. Myanmar (Burma) was the best
            place
            to spend
            a month, for living in a country without technology more than an overloaded built pickup truck will really
            bring
            you
            back to your roots. And it showed in the people, despite their feudally genocidal government. There are no
            suicides there,
            there is no depression. Only. Community.</p>

        <p>There we have it. Its not much, but its been nicely packed.</p>

        <p>
            <br/>Extrapolating from that, here's my life goal:</p>

        <p>Increase social capital in the world. That is, people make people happy, and I want people to be happy.</p>

        <p>There were other things on this list, but I think that they are but auxiliary.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>Finally, here is a list of everything I know:</p>

        <p>Believe and be honest in yourself, always.</p>

        <p>Make alone time, always. Hours every week, and days every year.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>Sincerely,
            <br/>--Peter
